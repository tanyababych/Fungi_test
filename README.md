   In this portion of the code we were defining the abundance of fungi with different ecological roles and relative abundance of fungi. I was not the author of this code, but I was working with it and learning during my internship at the Czech Academy of Sciences (Prague, Czech Republic)

## Usage 
Till 57th row we are setting up the data and doing minimal preparation of data

Till 113th row we are looking at fungal ecology data

Till 214th row we are doing alpha-diversity testing to determine how many OTUs are in each sample. Calculating richness, shannon, evenness

Till 279th row we are doing beta-diversity to measure the distance between the samples

Till the 375th row we are defining the relative abundance 

And till the end we are establishing the graphs
